Abingdon Computer Science DECODE (**D**istribution **E**ngine for **C**omputational **O**penAI **D**evelopment **E**nvironment)

## What is DECODE?

DECODE (Distribution Engine for Computational OpenAI Development Environment) acts as a middleman between you and the OpenAI API. Rather than managing individual billing or unsecure API keys, DECODE allows the CS department to:

- **Provision Credentials:** Instantly generate temporary API keys for your projects.
- **Monitor Usage:** Keep track of token consumption to ensure fair access for all students.
- **Maintain Safety:** Ensure all interactions remain within the bounds of educational safety and school guidelines.

## What it does for you

Whether you are building a Python-based chatbot, exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) in A-Level Computer Science, or experimenting with AI-driven data analysis, DECODE provides:

- **Direct API Access:** Authenticate your applications using standard OpenAI libraries.
- **Usage Dashboard:** See how many tokens you have used and manage your project limits.
- **Secure Environment:** Work with the knowledge that your development environment is supported and protected by the school infrastructure.
